2. **Meta Description Length** - Target range: 50-160 characters

**Result:** ✅ **ALL PAGES PASS** - All pages meet SEO best practice standards.

## Audit Methodology

The audit was performed by programmatically scanning all page components for `<SEO>` component configurations, extracting the `title` and `description` props, and measuring their character lengths against industry-standard benchmarks established by Google and Bing.

### SEO Best Practice Standards

| Element | Minimum | Optimal | Maximum | Rationale |
|---------|---------|---------|---------|-----------|
| **Title** | 30 chars | 50-55 chars | 60 chars | Titles shorter than 30 chars may appear incomplete in search results; titles longer than 60 chars get truncated with "..." |
| **Description** | 50 chars | 120-155 chars | 160 chars | Descriptions shorter than 50 chars provide insufficient context; descriptions longer than 160 chars get cut off in SERPs |

### 1. Monitor Search Console Performance

- Submit the sitemap (`/sitemap.xml`) to Google Search Console and Bing Webmaster Tools
- Monitor click-through rates (CTR) for each page in search results
- If CTR is low for a specific page, consider A/B testing alternative titles and descriptions

### 2. Implement Structured Data

- ✅ **Already Implemented:** Course/Event Schema on Programs page
- ✅ **Already Implemented:** Article Schema on Insights articles
- **Future Enhancement:** Add Organization Schema to the homepage for enhanced brand visibility in search results

### 3. Optimize for Featured Snippets

Consider restructuring content on key pages to target featured snippet opportunities:

- **About Page:** Add a concise "What is NEXUS CHINA?" section with a 40-60 word definition
- **Programs Page:** Add a "Quick Comparison" table of the three program types
- **Insights Page:** Format articles with clear H2/H3 headings and bullet points to increase featured snippet eligibility

### 4. Local SEO (If Applicable)

If NEXUS CHINA has a physical office in the UK:

- Add LocalBusiness Schema with address and contact information
- Create a Google Business Profile
- Include location-specific keywords in relevant pages (e.g., "London-based China education consultancy")

### 5. Multilingual SEO (Future Enhancement)

When the bilingual (English/Chinese) feature is implemented:

- Add `hreflang` tags to indicate language variants
- Create separate Chinese-language meta titles and descriptions optimized for Baidu (China's primary search engine)
- Ensure Chinese meta descriptions are 50-80 characters (Baidu's optimal range differs from Google)

### 6. Regular Content Updates
